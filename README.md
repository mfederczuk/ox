## About ##

> Simple to configure C & C++ build system

**Ox** is a build system (similar to **Make**), for C & C++ projects. It supports modules, build types and tests.

**Ox** is not anywhere near as customizable as a Makefile, but it is certainly easier and faster to setup.

## Usage ##

<!-- TODO: usage -->

## Download, Building & Installation ##

**Ox** uses **[libfyaml v0.7]**, which needs to be installed to build **Ox**.

[libfyaml v0.7]: https://github.com/pantoniou/libfyaml/tree/v0.7
