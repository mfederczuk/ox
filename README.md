## About ##

Ox is a declarative build system for C & C++ software projects,
heavily inspired by other build tools like [Gradle] and [Make].

[Gradle]: <https://gradle.org> "Gradle Build Tool"
[Make]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)> "Make (software) - Wikipedia"

### Name ###

Ox is *not* an abbreviation/acronym.
It is named after [the animal][wikipedia_ox], and is also pronounced the same way. (i.e.: `ˈɒks`, ***not*** `o.ɛks`)

The name is a reference to the [GNU] project/operating system.  
Both animals that these projects are named after (the ox and the gnu/wildebeest) are part of
the [Bovidae] biological family and the GNU project had/has a big impact on not just Ox, but also on C, C++,
they're ecosystems, and the software development landscape as a whole.
